# 🤖 Impostor Syndrome Comparison Map

🔍 **A comprehensive evaluation and visualization tool**

**Impostor syndrome**, characterized by self-doubt, feelings of fraudulence, and pressure to achieve, often leads to questioning one's own abilities. This project harnesses the **Young Impostor Syndrome (YIS) scale** to identify symptoms through Likert-scale responses in a user-friendly web application. 

🧠 **How It Works**  
Users contribute personal information to expand our dataset, which originally focused on medical students. We apply **clustering algorithms** to this data, visualizing relationships between impostor syndrome traits and demographics in **2D/3D scatter plots**. These visualizations foster a deeper understanding of this phenomenon through advanced data analytics.

## 🛠️ About The Project

🚀 **Project Origins:**  
Developed for the **STEM Fellowship 2024** competition, this repository is evolving into a fully-fledged application. It includes a variety of visualizations and clustering tools that help users explore impostor syndrome dynamics. By providing information like age and experience, users can better understand how their traits compare to others.

🌐 **Data Expansion:**  
Our initial dataset, focused on predicting impostor syndrome in medical students, is continually enriched with online responses. User inputs are stored securely in the cloud, and the resulting clusters can be explored via dynamic 2D and 3D scatter plots.
